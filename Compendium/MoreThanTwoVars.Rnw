\section{Two (or more) way ANOVA}

We can fit a two (or more) way ANOVA model, without or with an interaction,
using the same modeling syntax.
<<help-aovplot>>=
median(cesd ~ substance | sex, data=HELPrct)
bwplot(cesd ~ subgrp | sex, data=HELPrct)
@
<<help-aov2>>=
summary(aov(cesd ~ substance + sex, data=HELPrct))
@
<<help-aov3>>=
summary(aov(cesd ~ substance * sex, data=HELPrct))
@
There's little evidence for the interaction, though there are statistically
significant main effects terms for \variable{substance} group and 
\variable{sex}.

<<help-interaction,tidy=FALSE>>=
xyplot(cesd ~ substance, groups=sex, 
  auto.key=list(columns=2, lines=TRUE, points=FALSE), type='a',
  data=HELPrct)
@
\Rindex{auto.key option}


\section{Multiple regression}
\myindex{multiple regression}%
\myindex{multivariate relationships}%

Multiple regression is a logical extension of the prior commands, where 
additional predictors are added.  This allows students to start to try to disentangle 
multivariate relationships.  

\InstructorNote[-2cm]{We tend to introduce multiple linear regression
early in our courses, as a purely descriptive technique, then return to it
regularly.  The motivation for this is described at length in the companion volume 
\emph{Start Modeling with R}.}

Here we consider a model (parallel slopes) for depressive symptoms as a function of Mental Component Score (MCS),
age (in years) and sex of the subject.

\newpage

<<help-multreg>>=
lmnointeract <- lm(cesd ~ mcs + age + sex, data=HELPrct)
summary(lmnointeract)
@
\myindex{interactions}%
We can also fit a model that includes an interaction between MCS and sex.
<<help-multreg2>>=
lminteract <- lm(cesd ~ mcs + age + sex + mcs:sex, data=HELPrct)
summary(lminteract)
anova(lminteract)
@
<<help-multreg3>>=
anova(lmnointeract, lminteract)
@

There is little evidence for an interaction effect, so we drop
this from the model.

\subsection{Visualizing the results from the regression}

\label{sec:plotFun}
\Rindex{plotFun()}%
\Rindex{makeFun()}%
The \function{makeFun()} and \function{plotFun()} functions from the \pkg{mosaic} package 
can be used to display the results from a regression model.  For this example, we might 
display the predicted CESD values for a range of MCS values a 36 year old male and female subject from the parallel
slopes (no interaction) model.
<<makeFUN>>=
lmfunction = makeFun(lmnointeract)
@

\Rindex{xyplot()}%
\Rindex{auto.key option}%
\Rindex{ylab option}%
\Rindex{groups option}%
\Rindex{add option}%
We can now plot this function for male and female subjects over a range of MCS (mental component score) values, along
with the observed data for 36 year olds.  
<<plotFUN,tidy=FALSE,fig.keep='last'>>=
xyplot(cesd ~ mcs, groups=sex, auto.key=TRUE, 
  data=filter(HELPrct, age==36))
plotFun(lmfunction(mcs, age=36, sex="male") ~ mcs, 
  xlim=c(0, 60), lwd=2, ylab="predicted CESD", add=TRUE)
plotFun(lmfunction(mcs, age=36, sex="female") ~ mcs, 
  xlim=c(0, 60), lty=2, lwd=3, add=TRUE)
@


\subsection{Coefficient plots}

\myindex{coefficient plots}%
It is sometimes useful to display a plot of the coefficients for a multiple regression model (along with their associated
confidence intervals).

\Rindex{mplot()}%
<<results='hide'>>=
mplot(lmnointeract, rows=-1, which=7)
@

\TeachingTip[-4cm]{Darker dots indicate regression coefficients where the 95\% confidence interval does not include the null hypothesis value of zero.}

\Caution[-2cm\{Be careful when fitting regression models with missing values (see also section \ref{sec:miss}).}

\newpage

\subsection{Residual diagnostics}
\myindex{residual diagnostics}
\myindex{regression diagnostics}

It's straightforward to undertake residual diagnostics for this model.  We begin by adding the
fitted values and residuals to the dataset.
\TeachingTip[-1cm]{The \function{mplot} function can also be used to create these graphs.}
\Rindex{resid()}%
\Rindex{fitted()}%
\Rindex{abs()}%
\InstructorNote{Here we are adding two new variables into an existing dataset. It's often a good practice to give the resulting dataframe a new name.}
<<tidy=FALSE>>=
HELPrct = mutate(HELPrct, residuals = resid(lmnointeract), 
  pred = fitted(lmnointeract))
@
<<tidy=FALSE, message=FALSE>>=
histogram(~ residuals, xlab="residuals", fit="normal", 
  data=HELPrct)
@

We can identify the subset of observations with extremely large residuals.

\Rindex{abs()}%
<<>>=
filter(HELPrct, abs(residuals) > 25)
@

\Rindex{cex option}%
\Rindex{type option}%
<<tidy=FALSE>>=
xyplot(residuals ~ pred, ylab="residuals", cex=0.3,
  xlab="predicted values", main="predicted vs. residuals",
  type=c("p", "r", "smooth"), data=HELPrct)
@
<<tidy=FALSE>>=
xyplot(residuals ~ mcs, xlab="mental component score", 
  ylab="residuals", cex=0.3,
  type=c("p", "r", "smooth"), data=HELPrct)
@

The assumptions of normality, linearity and homoscedasticity seem reasonable here.
\begin{problem}
The \dataframe{RailTrail} dataset within the \pkg{mosaic} package includes the counts 
of crossings of a rail trail in Northampton, Massachusetts for 90 days in 2005.  
City officials are interested in understanding usage of the trail network, and
how it changes as a function of temperature and day of the week.  
Describe the distribution of the variable \variable{avgtemp} in terms of its
center, spread and shape.
<<tidy=FALSE>>=
favstats(~ avgtemp, data=RailTrail)
densityplot(~ avgtemp, xlab="Average daily temp (degrees F)", 
  data=RailTrail)
@
\end{problem}
\begin{solution}
The distribution of average temperature (in degrees Fahrenheit) is approximately normally
distributed with mean 57.4 degrees and standard deviation of 11.3 degrees.
\end{solution}
\begin{problem}
The \dataframe{RailTrail} dataset also includes a variable called \variable{cloudcover}.  
Describe the distribution of this variable in terms of its
center, spread and shape.
\end{problem}
\begin{solution}
<<>>=
favstats(~ cloudcover, data=RailTrail)
densityplot(~ cloudcover, data=RailTrail)
@
The distribution of cloud cover is ungainly (almost triangular), with increasing probability for more
cloudcover.  The mean is 5.8 oktas (out of 10), with standard deviation of 3.2 oktas.  It tends to be
cloudy in Northampton!
\end{solution}
\begin{problem}
The variable in the \dataframe{RailTrail} dataset that provides the daily count
of crossings is called \variable{volume}. 
Describe the distribution of this variable in terms of its
center, spread and shape.
\end{problem}
\begin{solution}
<<>>=
favstats(~ volume, data=RailTrail)
densityplot(~ volume, xlab="# of crossings", data=RailTrail)
filter(RailTrail, volume > 700)
@
The distribution of daily crossings is approximately normally
distributed with mean 375 crossings  and standard deviation of 127 crossings.
There is one outlier with 736 crossings which occurred on a Monday holiday in the spring
(Memorial Day).  
\end{solution}
\begin{problem}
The \dataframe{RailTrail} dataset also contains an indicator of whether the day was 
a weekday (\variable{weekday==1}) or a weekend/holiday (\variable{weekday==0}).
Use \function{tally()} to describe the distribution of this categorical variable.
What percentage of the days are weekends/holidays?
\end{problem}
\begin{solution}
<<>>=
tally(~ weekday, data=RailTrail)
tally(~ weekday, format="percent", data=RailTrail)
@
Just over 30\% of the days are weekends or holidays.
\end{solution}
\begin{problem}
Use side-by-side boxplots to compare the distribution of \variable{volume} by day type in the \dataframe{RailTrail} dataset.
Hint: you'll need to turn the numeric \variable{weekday} variable into a factor variable using \function{as.factor()}.
What do you conclude?
\end{problem}
\begin{solution}
<<>>=
bwplot(volume ~ as.factor(weekday), data=RailTrail)
@
or
<<>>=
RailTrail = mutate(RailTrail, daytype = ifelse(weekday==1, "weekday", "weekend/holiday"))
bwplot(volume ~ daytype, data=RailTrail)
@
We see that the weekend/holidays tend to have more users.
\end{solution}

\begin{problem}
Use overlapping densityplots to compare the distribution of \variable{volume} by day type in the 
\dataframe{RailTrail} dataset.
What do you conclude?
\end{problem}
\begin{solution}
<<>>=
densityplot(volume ~ weekday, auto.key=TRUE, data=RailTrail)
@
We see that the weekend/holidays tend to have more users.
\end{solution}
\begin{problem}
Create a scatterplot of \variable{volume} as a function of \variable{avgtemp} using the \dataframe{RailTrail} dataset, along with a regression line and scatterplot
smoother (lowess curve).  What do you observe about the relationship?  
\end{problem}
\begin{solution}
<<>>=
xyplot(volume ~ avgtemp, xlab="average temperature (degrees F)", 
  type=c("p", "r", "smooth"), lwd=2, data=RailTrail)
@
We see that there is a positive relationship between these two variables, but the association is 
somewhat nonlinear (which makes sense as we wouldn't continue to predict an increase in usage when the 
temperature becomes uncomfortably warm).  
\end{solution}
\begin{problem}
Using the \dataframe{RailTrail} dataset,
fit a multiple regression model for \variable{volume} as a function of \variable{cloudcover}, \variable{avgtemp}, 
\variable{weekday} and the interaction
between day type and average temperature.
Is there evidence to retain the interaction term at the $\alpha=0.05$ level?
\end{problem}
\begin{solution}
<<>>=
fm = lm(volume ~ cloudcover + avgtemp + weekday + avgtemp:weekday, data=RailTrail)
summary(fm)
@
The interaction between average temperature and day-type is statistically significant (p=0.016).  We 
interpret this as being a steeper slope (stronger association) on weekdays rather than weekends.
(Perhaps on weekends/holidays people will tend to head out on the trails irrespective of the weather?)
\end{solution}
\begin{problem}
Use \function{makeFun()} to calculate the predicted number of crossings on a weekday with average 
temperature 60 degrees and no clouds.  Verify this calculation using the coefficients from the 
model.
<<>>=
coef(fm)
@
\end{problem}
\begin{solution}
<<>>=
myfun = makeFun(fm)
myfun(cloudcover=0, avgtemp=60, weekday=1)
@
We expect just over 480 crossings on a day with these characteristics.
\end{solution}
\begin{problem}
Use \function{makeFun()} and \function{plotFun()} to display predicted values for the number of crossings
on weekdays and weekends/holidays for average temperatures between 30 and 80 degrees and a cloudy day 
(\variable{cloudcover=10}).  
\end{problem}
\begin{solution}
<<>>=
myfun = makeFun(fm)
xyplot(volume ~ avgtemp, data=RailTrail)
plotFun(myfun(cloudcover=10, avgtemp, weekday=0) ~ avgtemp, lwd=2, add=TRUE)
plotFun(myfun(cloudcover=10, avgtemp, weekday=1) ~ avgtemp, lty=2, lwd=3, add=TRUE)
@
We
interpret this as being a steeper slope (stronger association) on weekdays rather than weekends.
(Perhaps on weekends/holidays people will tend to head out on the trails irrespective of the weather?)
\end{solution}
\begin{problem}
Using the multiple regression model, generate a histogram (with overlaid normal 
density) to assess the normality of the residuals.  
\end{problem}
\begin{solution}
<<>>=
histogram(~ resid(fm), fit="normal")
@
The distribution is approximately normal.
\end{solution}
\begin{problem}
Using the same model generate a scatterplot of the residuals versus predicted values and comment
on the linearity of the model and assumption of equal variance.
\end{problem}
\begin{solution}
<<>>=
xyplot(resid(fm) ~ fitted(fm), type=c("p", "r", "smooth"))
@
The association is fairly linear, except in the tails.  There's some evidence that the variability of the residuals increases with larger fitted values.
\end{solution}
\begin{problem}
Using the same model generate a scatterplot of the residuals versus average temperature and comment on the linearity of the model and assumption of equal variance.
\end{problem}
\begin{solution}
<<>>=
xyplot(resid(fm) ~ avgtemp, type=c("p", "r", "smooth"), data=RailTrail)
@
The association is somewhat non-linear.  There's some evidence that the variability of the residuals increases with larger fitted values.
\end{solution}
